# Antora Tools

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/fb51907ca31441e1b0f8e122e38b1c44)](https://www.codacy.com/app/settermjd/antora-tools?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=settermjd/antora-tools&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This project provides a set of PHP-based tools for working with Antora projects.

## Current Feature Set

As Antora is still a relatively new project, there is still quite a bit to be done, such as providing tools to help in migrating from other documentation platforms. This project is aimed at helping out in that regard, by providing a, PHP-based, set of tools to ease the setup and migration from other platforms, along with other functionality, such as generating a PDF document from an existing Antora project setup.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to first ensure that you have a copy of PHP 7.2 installed. After that you have three choices:

1. You can use the library in a project of your own.
2. You can use the tools from the command-line, by running `php application.php`.
3. You can use the Phar file with an existing Antora project standalone.
